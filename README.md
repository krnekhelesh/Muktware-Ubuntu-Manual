Requirements and Setup
----------------------

In order to contribute to the Muktware Ubuntu Manual you need to have a working idea of Latex and Git. If you do, then you need to have the following setup. First, you need to have LaTeX installed on your system. You can google this to find more information on how to do this on your system. On Ubuntu, it is as simple as installing the package *TeXlive* from the Ubuntu Software Center.

Second, install *Git revision system* on your system. Again this process is similar to install LaTeX on your system. Fork this repository to any location on your hard-disk. You can now work on it, and then submit a pull request. I will review the changes and then merge them into the master tree.

Compiling Latex files
---------------------

Compiling Latex files is easier done from an editor such as *TexWorks*, *Texmaker*, *Sublime Text 2* etc. All these editor are available on Windows and Ubuntu.
